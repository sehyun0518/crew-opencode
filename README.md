## 🚀 Introduction

**crew-opencode** is a multi-agent orchestration system that coordinates specialized AI agents to work together on software development tasks. Instead of using a single expensive model for everything, crew-opencode strategically assigns tasks to the right agent with the right model, optimizing both cost and quality.

When you type the `crew` command, you become the **Project Manager**, directing a team of specialized agents that follow structured **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** to deliver high-quality results.

## 💡 Core Philosophy

1. **Cost-Effective**: Simple, repetitive tasks go to lightweight models (Haiku), while complex reasoning uses top-tier models (Opus). This approach reduces costs by 60-70% compared to using premium models for everything.

2. **Specialization**: Each agent is an expert in their domain (PM, Technical Analysis, Frontend, Design, QA) with tailored prompts and optimal model selection.

3. **Accountability**: When agents fail, they generate **Incident Reports ("Apology Letters")** with root cause analysis, risk assessment, and prevention strategies—ensuring continuous improvement.

## 👥 The Crew

Five specialized agents working together:

| Agent | Role | Model | Cost | Specialty |
|-------|------|-------|------|-----------|
| **PM** | Project Manager | Claude Opus 4.5 | 💰💰💰 | Orchestration, strategy, planning |
| **TA** | Technical Analyst | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 💰💰 | Research, architecture, analysis |
| **FE** | UI/UX Engineer | Gemini 3 Pro | 💰💰 | Frontend implementation |
| **Design** | Designer | GPT 5.2 Medium | 💰💰 | UX flows, design systems |
| **QA** | Quality Assurance | Claude Haiku 4.5 | 💰 | Testing, verification |

**Cost Optimization**: By using Haiku for QA (repetitive testing) and Opus only for PM (critical decisions), you get premium quality at a fraction of the cost.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **5 specialized agents** with role-specific prompts and optimal models
